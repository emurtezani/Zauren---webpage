# 📄 Description of the website
🎯 This website was created for **Zauren** - service business which deals with cleaning and maintenance of buildings, 
gardens and swimming pools, as well as minor construction works. The purpose of building ths website was to make
the company more visible and present online with aim to attract more clients to the newly opened service bussiness.

It is a simple website that provides all the necessary information about the services that company provides to its clients.
