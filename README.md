# description of the website
This website was created for **Zauren** - service business which deals with cleaning and maintenance of buildings, 
gardens and swimming pools, as well as minor construction works. The purpose of building ths website was to make
the company more visible and to attract more clients to the newly opened service bussiness.

It is a simple website that provides all the necessary information about the services that company provides to its clients. 
There is a button in the header that redirects the user to another page where the company's contact information and a form for contacting the company are located.
There is also the main detailed text about the company's activities, and in the footer, clients can find the information such as contact details, address and opening hours. 
The webpage is enriched with two simple photos describing the company‘s activities.
